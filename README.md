### `Monte Carlo Estimation with React + HTML canvas`

1. npm install
2. npm start

I started from a react boiler plate.

This application has 2 features.

1. it can estimate value of PI using monte carlo simulation
2. it can estimate the area under the curve for a given function (y=|f(x)|)

Most important files are App.js in /src, and canvas_worker.js in /src/worker
